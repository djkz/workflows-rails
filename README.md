# README

The goal of this project is to experiment with a different code layout:

Instead of CRUD, we are focusing on our workflows and domains.

* lib/workflows - workflows allow us to see all actions performed in the workflow, for example our store lets us browse, view, buy and refund books.
* lib/domains - domains allow us to keep the models thin and give names to things that are specifically in that domain.


## get started
Create a user model, and a couple of book models, then run `rails server`
